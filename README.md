# Learning Typescript

## Task Manager

This app is built to help keep track of multiple tasks for multiple projects.  
I built out the API for this project a long time ago, and now I am rebuilding the front-end in React, Redux Toolkit, and Typescript

## Overview

The top down look at this project starts of simple, but I added things to make it a little more complex to help me grow as a developer. This Task Manager will track multiple projects, along with giving you the ability to add people to a single project to help. You create tasks with a priority level of "High", "Medium", or "Low". As the creater of the project, or someone that you assign as the "Admin" will have the ablity to add team members to the project, create new tickets, and assign tickets to people on the project. When you are working on a specific task you will be able to set that task as your current focus.

## This Project API

I have had to make several changes to the API that I built to add in new features for this. Some of the new features that I had to add was the ability to add teammembers to your project. Instead of just tracking your own projects, you can now team up with someone. There are 2 levels of team members, Admin and Team. Admin has the ability to add new tickets, add new team members, and assign tickets to team members. Team member can only complete tickets.

## Learning

Going into this project I have used React, JS, and I have built out APIs before. Some of the changes I made to the API where new for me, so there was some learing for that. Also, I added in Redux Toolkit, and that was something that I had not used prior to this project, along with typescript. Getting the basics of typescript down didn't take as long as I thought it would have, but there are still a few things that I run into that puts me into a rabbit hole on stackoverflow. I have enjoyed learning typescript, and I think moving forward it will be used in a lot of my projects.
