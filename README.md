# Learning Typescript

## Task Manager

This app is built to help keep track of multiple tasks for multiple projects.  
I built out the API for this project a long time ago, and now I am rebuilding the front-end in React using Typescript
As of now I have never used typescript, and I felt this project was due for a face lift. I have not decided if I will use this project to also give Redux another shot.  
I will keep track of issues I run into in this readme while I am learning. Along with taking notes of things that are going well with the project.

## What is going well?

Most of the stuff once I use it I can understand how to use it. At least for the instance that I am using it for. I'm sure down the road I will run into times where I wont understand something that I have used more than once because the context is a lot different.

## What is going wrong?

There are some things with typescript that feel weird. I am not use to having to declare what something in state is like `({userName: String, password: String})`
